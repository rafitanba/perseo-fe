# Perseo Context-aware Complex Event Processing

Perseo is the GEri of the Context-aware Complex Event Processing (Context-aware CEP) GE. It is a module that listens to events from context data (coming from Orion Context Broker or any other NGSI-compliant system or service) in real-time, and generates immediate insight, enabling thus instant response to changing conditions.

Context-aware Complex Event Processing GE defines an open API that allows developers to manage matching-rules exposing CRUD operations, and feed it with NGSI10 notifications to trigger actions.

This documentation is under development and will be soon released.
